            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <section id="introduction-about-this-page">
                <h3>About This Page</h3>
                <p>This page is an amalgam of method to study mathematics which I've ever seen before.</p>
            </section>
            
        </section>

        <section id="Memorization">
            <h2>Memorization</h2>
            <p>To construct valid mathematical arguments, commit to memorizing all definitions and statements of theorems. </p>
            <p>While this may not always be enjoyable, it is necessary for success in math. To help with the process, consider the following tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the importance of each definition and theorem and why you need to memorize them.</li>
                <li>Share what you have memorized with someone else to reinforce the information in your memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even if you forget the definitions and theorems over time, don't be discouraged. The process of memorization will still help improve your mathematical skills and maturity.■</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Basics">
            <h2>Learning the Basics</h2>
            <p>When learning something new, it's important to start with the basics and practice until you can understand them without thinking deeply. For example, when learning a new language, it's essential to learn the alphabet, basic vocabulary, and grammar rules before attempting to have complex conversations or write long essays.</p>
            <p>Similarly, in mathematics, you must first understand fundamental concepts such as definitions, basic operations, well-known theorems before moving on to more advanced concepts .</p>
            <p>By taking the time to learn the basics and practicing until you can understand them without much effort, you build a solid foundation that will help you as you tackle more complex topics in the future.</p>         
            <p>Finally, aim to increase the number of operations and logic that can be processed unconsciously to improve your overall understanding and ability to process information more efficiently. ■</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Examples">
            <h2>Importance of Examples and Counterexamples</h2>
            <p>Examples are important. When you understand a definition or theorem, you need to be able to state some examples. 
            Try to conceive some examples. 
            </p>
            <p>If you meet something incomprehensible, make an example even if it is too trivial. Then examine or generalize it. ■</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Attitude">
            <h2>Attitude</h2>
            <p>Endure the stress from incomprehensibleness. It is natural not to fully or easily understand abstract math for a layperson. 
            These incomprehensibles can be easily understood after a while, when your mathematical maturity improved.
            
            </p>
            <p>
            Keep asking why do I need this concept? Why does this concept important? ■
            </p>
        </section>

        
        <section id="Smallcircle">
            <h2>Draw a Small Circle</h2>
            <p>Don't jump into the big ocean in the first place. Try to focus on mastering a small field or concept. ■</p>
        </section>


        <section id ="Aptitude">
            <h2>Aptitude</h2>
            Aptitude for mathematics has many elements as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Manipulation of Formula</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to execute clever transformations of complex expressions and to solve equations.</li>
                        <li>Rote learning of answers is not use.  </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li> 
                    <h3>Geometric Intuition</h3> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to visualize abstract things by drawing them in your head.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>  
                    <h3>Logic</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ability to reason logically step by step.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            In addition to these <b>strong interest in research topic </b>  and <b>daily constant research activity</b>  are necessary.■
        </section>

        <section id="Readings">
        <h2>Readings</h2>
        <p>When reading a textbook, it's not always effective to read one sentence "perfectly". 
            Instead, it's important to grasp the overall framework and big picture to better understand contents. 
            To effectively absorb the content of each chapter, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Quickly flip through each page to get an idea of what to expect and the chapter's structure.</li>
            <li>Read the questions at the end of the chapter to help your brain notice key information while reading.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to <b>the bold words</b> , such as titles and subtitles, to understand the chapter's structure better.</li>
            <li>Read the first and last sentences of each paragraph to get an idea of its main topic and key points.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Finally, read through the chapter, take notes, and connect the dots to bring everything together.■</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Output">
            <h2>Output</h2>
            <p>The output of your efforts is also important. 
            For example, writting small sections, posting videos to YouTube can be considered an output of your creative efforts. 
            The Feynman Technique and the mind map are another options. ■</p>
        </section>

        
        <section id="TheFeynmanTechnique">
            <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
            <p> The Feynman Technique is a simple method that make you understand abstract concepts more clearly.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find a topic you want to learn and study it.</li>
                <li>Take a piece of paper and write down everything you just learned as if you're teaching it to someone else. 
                    <br> By doing this, you can find out what you have forgotten and come back to study it again. </li>
                <li>After you've done everything, write it all in a simpler manner, which means use simpler words. ■</li>
            </ol>
