         <article class="Memorization">
             <h2>Memorization</h2>
             <p>
               According to Prof. S.R. , you must commit to memorize all definitions and statements of theorems,
               for these are the tools by which you can construct valid mathematical arguments.
               Of course, memorization is not always fun, but sometimes it is just simply required. Here's some tips,</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Define yourself why you need this definition or theorem. This motivates you to remenber them.</li>
                  <li>Tell someone what you memorized.</li>
               </ul>
             <p>After memorized the statements completely, you will forget them gradually. But don't feel depressed about it. Once you have memorized them, your mathematical maturity should have improved somewhat. </p>

         <article class="Examples">
             <h2>Importance of Examples / Counterexamples</h2>
             <p>Examples are important. When you understand a definition or theorem, you need to be able to state some examples. 
               Try to conceive some examples. 
             </p>
             <p>If you meet something incomprehensible, make an example even if it is too trivial. Then generalize it.</p>

         <article class="Attitude">
            <h2>Attitude</h2>
            <p>Endure the stress from incomprehensibleness. It is natural not to fully or easily understand abstract math for a layman. 
               These incomprehensibles can be easily understood after a while, when your mathematical maturity improved.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               Keep asking why do I need this concept? Why does this concept important?

         <article class="TheFeynmanTechnique">
             <h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>
             <p> The Feynman Technique is a simple method that make you understand abstract concepts more clearly.
               <ol>
                  <li>Find a topic you want to learn and study it.</li>
                  <li>Take a piece of paper and write down everything you just learned as if you're teaching it to someone else. 
                     <br> By doing this, you can find out what you have forgotten and come back to study it again. </li>
                  <li>After you've done everything, write it all in a simpler manner, which means use simpler words.</li>
                </ol>

      <h2>Aptitude for Mathematics</h2>
      Aptitude for mathematics is as follows
      <ol>
         <li>Manipulation of Formula
            <ul>
               <li>Ability to execute clever transformations of complex expressions and to solve equations</li>
               <li>Rote learning of answers is not use  </li>
             </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Geometric Intuition
            <ul>
               <li>Ability to visualize abstract things by drawing them in your head</li>
             </ul>
         </li>
         <li>Logic
            <ul>
               <li>Ability to reason logically step by step</li>
             </ul>
         </li>
      </ol>
      In addition to these strong interest in research topic and daily constant research activity are necessary.
